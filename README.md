# 📊 City Line Project: Predicting Urban Trends with Data Science

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **City Line Project** is a data-driven initiative aimed at optimizing **urban management and resource allocation** in **Syracuse, NY**. This project leverages **machine learning and predictive analytics** to analyze **thousands of service requests** related to **waste management, infrastructure, public safety, and property maintenance**.

### 🔍 Key Objectives:  
- **Analyze historical service request data** to identify patterns and trends.  
- **Develop time-series forecasting models** to predict future demand.  
- **Provide actionable insights** for city officials, businesses, and policymakers.  
- **Optimize resource allocation** for better urban management.

## 📈 Methodology  

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- **Handling missing values** (imputation, removal for key fields)  
- **Feature Engineering** (Extracting time-based features, categorization)  
- **Outlier Detection & Removal**  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Visualizing request trends over time**  
- **Identifying seasonal peaks in different service categories**  
- **Mapping geographic hotspots for service requests**  

### 3️⃣ Time-Series Forecasting  
- **Facebook Prophet Model** for trend and seasonality detection  
- **ARIMA Model** for short-term forecasting  
- **Moving Averages & Exponential Smoothing** for smoothing request patterns  

### 4️⃣ Insights & Recommendations  
- **Optimized scheduling for waste management (15-20% cost reduction)**  
- **Seasonal property maintenance insights (30% spike in spring/summer)**  
- **Forecasted increase in potholes & parking violations (+25% by 2025)**  
- **Public safety resource allocation based on 12% YoY growth**
